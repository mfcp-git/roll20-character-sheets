	"instructions": "This sheet is designed for use with the Burning Wheel system written by Luke Crane and produced with permission for use on Roll20.\nMuch of the Character Burner process has been enhanced with auto calculating values and many of the final results translate to the rest of the sheet.\nHovering over most of the Stats & Skills will reveal with underlying Roll20 Attribute names. \nRoll by clicking on the white D6 next to Stats/Skills/Attributes names in order to make use of the roll template. \nIn the roll query you'll be asked for a Modifier which represents dice that affect the comparison to Obs, Artha (such as Persona or Deeds dice) that add to the roll but don't compare to the Obs, and the base Obs. \nWound dice and Obs penalties from wounds are automatically calculated from the PTGS & Gear tab into rolls that are affected by wound penatlies. \nThe star symbol to the right of an ability exponent mark's the roll as Open Ended and will cause any 6s rolled to explode. \nTo the far right of each skill is an invisible 'mod symbol' which will turn that skill instead a group separator instead. \nThere is now also a 'Magic' tab to put your spells and songs in, but all of the title fields are re-namable so additional homebrew / codex content could be put here also. And there's a new 'Rogues' tab for tracking PC bodyguards and animal companions, multiple NPCs within an organisation, or simple creature stat-blocks as described in BWG pp 565-571. \nEnjoy!\n\n[Readme](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/blob/master/Burning%20Wheel/readme.md). v2.3 (2020-11-20)."
