Tales of Xadia: The Dragon Prince RPG - Playtest Character Sheet - Cortex Prime

##Set up

- Open the Journal tab, and add a new Character.
- Click on save changes.
- Open the Attributes and Abilities tab.
- Add an attribute called "Edit" and assign it the value "on".
- Now switch to the Character Sheet tab.
- Select the Character name from the list - this will select the character portrait and fill out the distinction blocks.
- Set the dice values for the Attributes, Values, and Specialities using the further drop downs.
- Hide the Editor by removing the edit field from the Attributes and Abilities tab, or by assigning it the value "off".
- Enter the remaining details - Name, Description, Value statements and Asset details in the editable text fields.

- Repeat this for each of the remaining characters.

##Dice Pool Builder

The inbuilt Dice Pool Builder pulls from the character's attributes, rolls and keeps highest two dice in the pool by default. I refer to this as the suggested best result.

##Stress

I have been using API macro's to adjust Stress values. But these are simply Attributes (Afraid, Angry, Corrupted, Exhausted, Injured, Insecure) As with the Edit attribute add these to the Attributes and Abilities tab, and assign values ranging from the set 4,6,8,10 or 12 corresponding to the dice value.

The traits will only display on the character sheet as they are assigned to the character, in the same manner as the Specialities. If you have added a stress and it's not showing check the spelling, Capitalisation, and dice value to be sure you got those all correct.

Any feedback, or requests - I'm happy to hear.
