# Maximum Apocalypse

Building the sheet from scratch, while learning Roll20 custom sheet conventions & CCS grids along the way.

Haven't actually played a game of Maximum Apocalypse yet, but it look like a really fun setting with interesting chracter, roll & inventory mechanics.

I'm using this project as a way to become familiar with the mechanics.

## Usage Notes

- Structure very close to to core rulebook
- Deviations implemented to provide enough room for Special Ability and Gear descriptions
- Drop down selections for archetypes, apocalypse & skill proficiencies
- Special Ability and Gear descriptions can be expanded/contracted to see the full text when needed
- The sheet will automatically calculate all derived stats: half/quarter stats, special stats, build/repair table & encumbrance
- Initiative includes modifiers from being encumbered, shaken, acute, starving & emaciated.
- Hunger conditions will highlight in red when active

## Planned enhancements

- Add roll buttons with advantage/disadvantage modifier entered by player.

## Change Log 

### November 26th 2020 v2.0

- Changed structure so repeating groups have enough room to show text & many entries won't stretch the sheet 
- Used textareas for special ability and gear descriptions; user can then expand/contract these to see the full text when needed.
- Changed font for numbers from Bangers (since 1 & 7 look too similar) to Candal (one of Roll20's default fonts)
- Added sheet workers for all derived stats: half/quarter stats, special stats, build/repair table & encumbrance
- Initiative sheet worker includes modifiers from being encumbered, shaken, acute, starving & emaciated.
- Hunger conditions will highlight in red when active

- First version
- Full layout to match core rulebook, using Blinker & Bangers Google fonts
